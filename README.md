# JS_Challenges

Hi, this repository contains all of my daily/weekly/monthly JS challenges 
(This is NOT a project repository)

## JS Chellenge #5 (Feb 20, 2023)

### What I learned

Working on this challenge, I was able to improve my HTML and JS skills. I learned...

- how to input text in a text box
- how to select a value from drop-down menus
- how to select a value from radio buttons
- how to select values from check boxes

- how to rendered out all values above using a simple innerHTML and for-loop in Javascript
